# How to Instrument iOS apps

This is a deliberately broken app to help demonstrate how Instruments works. Youâ€™re welcome to read the code and admire how broken it is, but really you should follow the tutorials to help you find and fix the issues here.

The headlines were taken from various old Guardian articles, but the pictures are just placeholders to avoid copyright issues.

As new tutorials are published I'll link them below. Questions? Comments? [Tweet me @twostraws](https://twitter.com/twostraws) or email <paul@hackingwithswift.com>.
